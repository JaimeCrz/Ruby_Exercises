'4' == 4 ? puts ('TRUE') : puts('FALSE')

# 2- After the math operation it will return if both paranthesis are equal. or not.

# 3- It will output:  Alright now! (x+1) is 11 which is greater than 9.

# 4- You forgot to put the 'end' of the if loop. /or the end of the def, what ever makes you happier!
